# Activation-function

The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating the weighted sum and further adding bias to it.
The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron. 

The neural network has neurons that work in correspondence with weight, bias, and their respective activation function. 
In a neural network, update the weights and biases of the neurons on the basis of the error at the output. 
This process is known as `back-propagation`. Activation functions make the back-propagation possible since the gradients
are supplied along with the error to update the weights and biases.
